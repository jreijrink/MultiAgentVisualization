This prototype is developped for TechUnited.

Java 8 is required to run the prototype (http://openjdk.java.net/install/).<br />
To start the prototype double-click "Prototype.jar" or run "java -jar Prototype.jar" in your terminal.

The goal of the prototype is to support the analysis after each game to detect anomalies faster.
The base consists of several configurable charts that are linked with each other.
In this way, different parameters can easily be compared with each other at the same time.
The prototype also has a visualization of the field.

The prototype is still under development and could therefore be slow and might crash.
You can contact me if you don’t get the prototype working, have questions or come up with a new feature for the prototype.
I would appreciate to receive feedback about the prototype.
Thanks for using and evaluating the prototype.

For more information about the prototype read "Visualization of multi-agent systems - Prototype manual.pdf".<br />
A compiled version with all required files can be found in the ”release” directory.
